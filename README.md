# Laputa

Laputa is used to store Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations for me. 

IaC is a software engineering practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage using code and automation. Laputa enables me to automate the deployment and management of their infrastructure resources using configuration files, scripts, and templates.
